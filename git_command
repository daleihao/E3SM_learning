pull another branches 
# First add 'E3SM' main repo as a new remote (e3sm)
git remote add e3sm git@github.com:E3SM-Project/E3SM

# Here is the explanation of what the above 
# Think of 'origin' and 'e3sm' as pointer. In your case,
# origin was pointing to your repo: git@github.com:daleihao/e3sm
# e3sm now points to git@github.com:E3SM-Project/E3SM

# Now get new stuff from e3sm repo
git fetch e3sm

# Now checkout my branch from e3sm repo
git checkout  bishtgautam/lnd/solar_rad_top

# Now update the submodules
git submodule update --init

# Now run the test
cd cime/scripts
./create_test SMS_Lm1.f09_f09.IELM.cori-knl_intel.elm-solar_rad



In running the test suite you do the following:
First, one creates “baselines” for the test suite. The baselines are some netcdf output files. You create the baseline using the hash on master from which you started your development.
Then, one switches to the last hash of their development branch. Runs the test suite and this time compares against the previously generated baseline.
If you didn’t fix a bug, the answers between the two should be bit-for-bit (BFB).
